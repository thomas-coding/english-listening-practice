# Material Analysis: Bob's Burgers (汉堡店)

## What it is
- Very large mixed-format corpus (mp4/mkv/mp3/srt/pdf).
- MP3 set: 285 episodes, average ~22 minutes.

## Pedagogical value
- Strong for colloquial and humorous conversational English.
- Good authenticity bridge toward YouTube-style informal speech.

## Risks

- Data volume is huge; must pre-filter by teachability.

## Recommended role in curriculum
- Mid/late-stage source for informal expression and speed tolerance.
- Use curated episodes with clean subtitle support first.

## Open tasks
- Build curated starter list (10 episodes) with good subtitle quality.
- Build expression bank from recurring family/school/work contexts.
