# EnglishPod First-30 Sequence With Topic Tags (Seed v1)

## Scope
- Purpose: extend EnglishPod sequencing from first 10 to first 30 episodes with topic tags.
- Source: `D:\邬金平\englishpod`.
- Data note: PB/RV/DG durations and triad completeness were validated for `0001-0030`.

## Tag schema
- Topic tags: `service`, `work`, `social`, `health`, `travel`, `finance`, `holiday`, `culture`, `planning`, `routine`.
- Tier tags:
  - `E1`: lower lexical/inference load.
  - `E2`: moderate load with denser turn-taking.
  - `E3`: abstract or specialized topic, or high total triad load.

## Recommended lesson progression after first 10
- L11-L16: prioritize E1-E2 episodes (`0023`,`0026`,`0027`,`0024`,`0016`,`0017`).
- L17-L24: move to E2 core with one E1 buffer slot every 3 lessons.
- L25-L30: add E3 episodes gradually (`0018`,`0021`,`0025`,`0029`) once gist remains stable.

## Control rules
- If recap quality drops below target for 2 consecutive lessons, downgrade one tier for next lesson.
- For episodes with triad total >22 minutes, only use selected segments, not full-triad playback.
