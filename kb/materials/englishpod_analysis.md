# Material Analysis: EnglishPod

## What it is
- 365 episode structure with `pb` (dialogue), `rv` (review), `dg` (dialogue replay/related segment) for many lessons.
- Average `pb` around ~13 minutes (varies by episode).

## Pedagogical value
- Excellent for staged listening: raw input -> explanation -> reinforcement.
- Highly suitable for 30-minute lessons.
- Rich in spoken chunks and situational language.

## Risks
- Some metadata inconsistency across folders/files.
- Not all episodes have the same completeness quality.

## Recommended role in curriculum
- Daily core module for chunk extraction and retell.
- Use `pb` for first-pass challenge, `rv/dg` for repair and consolidation.

## Open tasks
- Build a priority list of episodes by difficulty and utility.
- Add tags: business/daily/social/argument/emotion.
