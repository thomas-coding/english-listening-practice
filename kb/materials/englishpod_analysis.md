# Material Analysis: EnglishPod

## What it is
- 365 episode structure with `pb` (dialogue), `rv` (review), `dg` (dialogue replay/related segment) for many lessons.
- Average `pb` around ~13 minutes (varies by episode).

## Pass #3 writeback (first-10 sequence)
- A first-10 lesson sequence with measured PB/RV/DG durations is now defined in:
  - `kb/materials/englishpod_first10_sequence.md`
- Coverage check for episodes `0001-0030`: PB/RV/DG triads are complete for sampled set.
- This closes the initial sequence gap for EnglishPod in early lesson design.

## Pass #5 writeback (first-30 sequence with tags)
- A first-30 sequence with topic and tier tags is now defined in:
  - `kb/materials/englishpod_first30_sequence.md`
- This adds progression controls after lesson 10 and a safer ramp into higher-load episodes.

## Pedagogical value
- Excellent for staged listening: raw input -> explanation -> reinforcement.
- Highly suitable for 30-minute lessons.
- Rich in spoken chunks and situational language.

## Risks
- Some metadata inconsistency across folders/files.
- Not all episodes have the same completeness quality.

## Recommended role in curriculum
- Daily core module for chunk extraction and retell.
- Use `pb` for first-pass challenge, `rv/dg` for repair and consolidation.

## Teaching use constraints
- Avoid full-track passive listening; use targeted segments tied to one confusion hotspot.
- Keep output mandatory after `rv` (gist/details/recap) to prevent explanation-only dependency.

## Open tasks
- Expand from first-30 to first-60 sequence.
- Calibrate topic/tier tags using real lesson outputs and recurrence errors.
