# Material Analysis: Fresh Off the Boat (初来乍到)

## What it is
- Sitcom corpus with mkv/mp3/lrc/script documents.
- MP3 average ~21 minutes.

## Pedagogical value
- Strong bridge from textbook-like speech to authentic conversational flow.
- Good for subtitle control progression: full -> partial -> none.

## Risks
- Some episodes lack aligned auxiliary subtitle files in certain formats.
- Dialogue density can spike; can overwhelm early-stage lessons.

## Recommended role in curriculum
- Mid-stage transition corpus.
- Use selected easier episodes first, then increase speed density.

## Open tasks
- Build episode difficulty tier list (A/B/C) for lesson assignment.
- Mark subtitle reliability per episode.
