# Material Analysis: Daily English

## What it is
- 1305 podcast episodes with large transcript PDFs.
- Average audio length ~18 minutes.

## Pass #2 writeback (first-10 lesson mapping)
- A seed lesson map for the first 10 real lessons is now defined in:
  - `kb/materials/daily_first10_lesson_map.md`
- The map uses duration-validated episodes and staged tiering (D1 -> D2 -> D3).
- This closes the "first 10 lessons" planning gap for Daily.

## Pass #4 writeback (first-30 progression map)
- A first-30 progression pool with tier and topic tags is now defined in:
  - `kb/materials/daily_first30_progression_map.md`
- This adds expansion rules after lesson 10 and recovery controls for difficulty bumps.

## Pedagogical value
- Controlled, clear speech for decoding foundation.
- Strong for high-frequency daily life domains.
- Good for precision listening and recap training.

## Risks
- If used alone, transfer to authentic YouTube can be weak.

## Recommended role in curriculum
- Early and mid-stage backbone for accuracy building.
- Use in 30-min lesson as one precision segment (not whole lesson).

## Teaching use constraints
- Keep no-sub first-pass chunk short (60-150 seconds) to preserve output quality.
- Prefer one confusion hotspot repair, not full replay, to avoid passive listening drift.

## Open tasks
- Expand from first-30 to first-60 progression map.
- Add lexical burden and speaking-output quality tags based on real lesson logs.
