# Material Analysis: Desperate Housewives (绝望主妇)

## What it is
- Large corpus with mkv/mp3/lrc/txt/docx and script variants.
- MP3 set: 180 episodes, average ~43 minutes.

## Coverage validation (Pass #1 writeback)
- Video episodes detected by season/episode pattern: 178.
- Transcript assets detected by season/episode pattern:
  - LRC: 180
  - TXT: 180
  - DOCX: 180
- Missing transcript against detected video episodes: 0.
- Interpretation: transcript support is effectively full for lesson chunking and repair drills.

## Pedagogical value
- Excellent for long-form listening stamina.
- Rich in social, emotional, conflict-driven natural dialogue.
- Multiple transcript formats support fast switch between dictation, chunk extraction, and recap prep.

## Risks
- Episode length is long for 30-minute lessons; needs chunking.
- Language style includes fast interpersonal exchanges and idioms.

## Entry strategy (for this learner)
- Start from S01 clips first to reduce topic shock (learner already saw S01E01-02 once).
- Clip length: 2-4 minutes for normal days, 45-90 seconds for repair days.
- Do not use full episodes as a single task in current stage.

## Recommended role in curriculum
- Late mid-stage and advanced transition use.
- Use 2-6 minute clips for focused sessions before full-episode work.

## Lesson recipe (high-yield)
1. First pass no-sub gist (single play, no pause).
2. Targeted replay on one 20-40 second confusion segment.
3. Extract 5 reusable chunks (relationship, emotion, conflict).
4. 45-90 second spoken recap with at least 3 concrete details.

## Pass #11 writeback (micro-tags)
- Starter episode micro-tags are now included in:
  - `kb/materials/sitcom_entry_microtags.md`
- These tags allow faster clip picking by state and scene objective.

## Pass #15 writeback (timestamp micro-tags)
- Timestamp-level starter clips (`start_end`) were added for S01E01-S01E04 in:
  - `kb/materials/sitcom_entry_microtags.md`
- This adds ready-to-use 90-second windows for 30-minute lesson routing.

## Open tasks
- Expand clip-level timestamp set from S01E01-04 to a 12-episode S01-S02 transition pack.
- Build "no-sub first-pass" checkpoints for this source.
