# Daily First-10 Lesson Map (Seed v1)

## Scope
- Purpose: define a practical first-10-lesson Daily track for this learner.
- Source: `D:\邬金平\pod\daily`.
- Data note: episode durations were validated locally via `ffprobe`.

## Selection rules
- Keep main episode duration mostly <= 22 minutes for manageable clipping.
- Start with service/daily-life topics, then move to workplace abstraction.
- Use one main episode per lesson plus one short review clip from previous lessons.

## Lesson seed list (L01-L10)
- L01: `0012 Small Talk About the Weather` (17.3m) | tier D1 | function: warm start and confidence rebuild.
- L02: `0014 Going to the Post Office` (20.8m) | tier D1 | function: transactional listening and detail capture.
- L03: `0016 Driving on the Freeways` (19.5m) | tier D2 | function: instruction-heavy comprehension.
- L04: `0018 Seeing Old Friends` (17.2m) | tier D1 | function: social conversation flow and recap fluency.
- L05: `0021 Getting an Interview` (17.3m) | tier D2 | function: workplace intent and response patterns.
- L06: `0022 Making a Good Impression` (15.4m) | tier D2 | function: pragmatic phrases and tone.
- L07: `0028 Cashing a Check` (16.2m) | tier D2 | function: service counter dialogue and key-detail retrieval.
- L08: `0023 A Visit to the Doctor` (25.3m) | tier D2+ | function: symptom/explanation structure under higher lexical load.
- L09: `0020 Formal Emails` (16.5m) | tier D3 | function: register shift and formal wording recognition.
- L10: `0019 Tough Negotiations` (22.0m) | tier D3 | function: argument structure and pressure-tolerant listening.

## In-lesson clipping policy (30-minute protocol)
- First pass no-sub chunk: 60-150 seconds.
- Repair pass chunk: 20-60 seconds from one confusion hotspot.
- Output requirement: one-sentence gist + 3 corrected errors + 5 reusable chunks + 45-90 second recap.

## Tier definitions
- D1: familiar topic, concrete vocabulary, lower discourse complexity.
- D2: mixed familiarity, more implicit relations, moderate lexical burden.
- D3: abstract/workplace reasoning, denser phrasing, higher inference demand.

## Follow-up tasks
- Add topic and lexical tags for L01-L10 after first real lesson cycle.
- Expand seed map to L11-L30 with the same tier logic.
