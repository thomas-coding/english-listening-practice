# YouTube Transfer Strategy (Draft)

## Position in learning pipeline
- Final transfer target, not day-1 primary corpus.

## Integration stages
1. Controlled intro: 3-5 minute clips with English subtitles.
2. Mixed mode: first pass no subtitles, second pass with subtitles.
3. No-sub primary: first pass no subtitles as default.

## Success criteria by stage
- Stage 1: can summarize gist + 3 details.
- Stage 2: no-sub first pass gist is stable (>60%).
- Stage 3: 8-12 minute normal videos, no-sub first pass >70%.

## Open tasks
- Build channel/topic ladder suitable for learner interests.
- Define video selection constraints (accent, speed, topic density).
- Add troubleshooting playbook for low-comprehension days.
