# EnglishPod First-10 Sequence (PB/RV/DG Seed v1)

## Scope
- Purpose: define a practical first-10-lesson EnglishPod sequence for this learner.
- Source: `D:\邬金平\englishpod`.
- Data note: PB/RV/DG durations were validated locally via `ffprobe`.

## Why this source is strategic
- `pb` gives raw dialogue challenge.
- `rv` gives repair scaffolding with explanation.
- `dg` gives short reinforcement for retrieval/output.
