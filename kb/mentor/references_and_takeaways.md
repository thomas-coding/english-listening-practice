# References and Takeaways (for system design)

## Consulted references (2026-02-09)
1. The Learning Scientists - Retrieval Practice.
2. The Learning Scientists - Spaced Practice.
3. Victoria University (Paul Nation resources page and linked resource ecosystem).
4. SLA overview references (interlanguage, variability, cognitive + sociocultural factors).
5. Deliberate practice literature summary references.

## Practical takeaways integrated into KB
- Retrieval + feedback must be mandatory in each lesson.
- Spaced review must be built into data model (review queue + due dates).
- Learner errors are developmental signals, not random noise -> error pattern tracker.
- Expertise growth needs deliberate weak-point focus -> stage-gate and adaptive rules.
- Long-term system needs anti-drift checks -> benchmark suite + regression scorecard.

## Caution
- Some web sources are broad summaries. Use them for system principles, not as sole empirical evidence.
