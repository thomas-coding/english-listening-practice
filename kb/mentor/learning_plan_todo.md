# Mentor Self-Learning Plan (TODO)

## Overall progress
- Estimated completion of mentor KB maturity: 31%
- Meaning: architecture + anti-drift QA + mastery trackers + stage-gates + KPI and gap handling done; deep material pedagogy and lesson optimization not yet complete.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure and standards (done)
- [x] Define persistent architecture.
- [x] Define learner model and competency dimensions.
- [x] Define logging and recovery protocol.
- [x] Define anti-drift guardrails and benchmark framework.
- [x] Define vocabulary/chunk/error mastery tracker schema.
- [x] Define KPI formulas and stage-gate progression control.
- [x] Define long-gap handling and backup/restore protocol.

## Phase 2: Material intelligence build (in progress)
- [ ] Build chunked difficulty maps for `daily` (topic, speed, lexical density).
- [ ] Build teachable sequence for `englishpod` (pb/rv/dg best usage).
- [ ] Build entry pathway for `初来乍到` by episode difficulty.
- [ ] Build entry pathway for `绝望主妇` by scene complexity.
- [ ] Build entry pathway for `burgers` by season and subtitle quality.

## Phase 3: Lesson engine refinement
- [ ] Create 30-min lesson blueprints for low/normal/high state days.
- [ ] Build adaptive test bank (quick 3-min, 10-min, 20-min checks).
- [ ] Build review scheduler rules from real lesson logs.

## Phase 4: YouTube transfer system
- [ ] Define channel/topic progression ladder.
- [ ] Define no-subtitle success criteria by video length.
- [ ] Define fallback protocol when transfer breaks.
