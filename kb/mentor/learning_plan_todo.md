# Mentor Self-Learning Plan (TODO)

## Overall progress
- Estimated completion of mentor KB maturity: 96%.
- Meaning: architecture is stable; material intelligence and lesson-engine details are now the main gap.

## Execution policy (expert growth)
- Each mentor-learning pass must produce all of the following:
  1) one concrete material writeback,
  2) one pedagogy/operations refinement,
  3) snapshot/log update for continuity.
- Keep YouTube as mandatory transfer target, but only after controlled and semi-authentic checkpoints are stable.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure and standards (done)
- [x] Define persistent architecture.
- [x] Define learner model and competency dimensions.
- [x] Define logging and recovery protocol.
- [x] Define anti-drift guardrails and benchmark framework.
- [x] Define vocabulary/chunk/error mastery tracker schema.
- [x] Define KPI formulas and stage-gate progression control.
- [x] Define long-gap handling and backup/restore protocol.

## Phase 2: Material intelligence build (in progress)
- [x] Build `daily` first-10 lesson difficulty seed map (episode picks + tiering + clipping policy).
- [x] Expand `daily` to first-30 map with topic/tier tags and recovery controls.
- [x] Build `englishpod` first-10 lesson sequence (pb/rv/dg timing baseline).
- [x] Expand `englishpod` to first-30 sequence with topic tags.
- [x] Build entry pathway for `初来乍到` by season tiers and subtitle reliability.
- [x] Build entry pathway baseline for `绝望主妇` by transcript coverage and scene complexity.
- [x] Build entry pathway baseline for `burgers` by season and subtitle quality.
- [x] Add sitcom starter micro-tags for fast lesson assembly.
- [x] Add timestamp-level clip tags (`start-end`) for sitcom starter entries.

## Phase 3: Lesson engine refinement
- [x] Create 30-min lesson blueprints for low/normal/high state days.
- [x] Build adaptive test bank (quick 3-min, 10-min, 20-min checks).
- [x] Build review scheduler baseline rules (v0) and set post-5-lesson recalibration trigger.

## Phase 4: YouTube transfer system
- [x] Define channel/topic progression ladder.
- [x] Confirm YouTube role: final transfer target with staged subtitle withdrawal.
- [x] Define no-subtitle success criteria by video length.
- [x] Define fallback protocol when transfer breaks.
- [x] Expand validated YouTube pool from 10 to 30 clips with Y1-Y4 balance.

## Pass backlog (next 4 passes)
1. Pass #17: prepare benchmark mini-set picks after first lesson evidence.
2. Pass #18: add YouTube clip quality tags for routing (`accent`, `speaker_count`, `subtitle_reliability`).
3. Pass #19: recalibrate review scheduler after first 5 real lessons.
4. Pass #20: run first benchmark mini-set after lesson #3.
