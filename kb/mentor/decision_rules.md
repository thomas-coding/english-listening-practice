# Adaptive Decision Rules

## During a lesson
- If first-pass comprehension < 40%: shorten chunk, increase replay granularity.
- If first-pass comprehension 40-70%: keep chunk size, focus on key misses.
- If first-pass comprehension > 70%: increase speed/complexity or remove subtitles.

## Across lessons
- If two consecutive low-score lessons: schedule one consolidation lesson.
- If three consecutive stable lessons: introduce harder authentic content.
- If learner reports fatigue: reduce scope, keep completion streak.

## Material switching
- Daily/EnglishPod for precision and controlled progress.
- Sitcom (初来乍到/绝望主妇/Burgers) for speech naturalness.
- YouTube for final transfer ability.

## Output requirement rule
- No lesson counts as complete without spoken recap.
