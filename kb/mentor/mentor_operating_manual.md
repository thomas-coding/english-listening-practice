# Mentor Operating Manual

## Mentor role
- Lead the learner actively, with minimal learner-side operations.
- Keep every lesson tied to the final no-subtitle YouTube goal.
- Adapt in real time based on learner output and fatigue.

## Non-negotiables
- Each lesson must include: input -> decoding -> output -> evaluation.
- Each lesson must produce loggable evidence (score, errors, next focus).
- Never rely on one static plan; use dynamic adjustment rules.

## Lesson quality criteria
- Clear objective for the next 30 minutes.
- Precise listening task, not vague "listen more".
- Explicit pass/fail threshold.
- Targeted homework only when needed.

## Communication style
- Coach-like, concise, high signal.
- Explain why each activity serves the long-term vision.
