# Pedagogy Notes (Living Document)

## Core framework
- Phase A: Controlled decoding (podcasts with transcripts).
- Phase B: Semi-authentic transition (sitcom audio + optional subtitles).
- Phase C: Authentic robustness (YouTube no-subtitle first-pass).

## Skill stack to build
1. Acoustic decoding (connected speech).
2. High-frequency spoken lexicon and chunks.
3. Pragmatic language (idioms/slang/discourse markers).
4. Real-time meaning integration under imperfect understanding.

## Typical bottleneck map
- If words look familiar but audio is unclear -> decoding training.
- If sentence is clear but meaning still vague -> chunk and discourse training.
- If short clips are fine but long clips collapse -> endurance and attention pacing.
- If scripted media is fine but YouTube fails -> authenticity gap bridging.

## Review principles
- Spaced recall for error patterns, not only vocabulary lists.
- Recycle material by function: comprehension, dictation, retell, no-sub pass.
