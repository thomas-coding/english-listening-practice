# Competency Model (v1)

## Dimensions (0-5 scale)
1. Sound decoding (linking, reduction, weak forms).
2. Vocabulary-in-context recognition.
3. Idiom/slang/pragmatic expression recognition.
4. Sentence-to-paragraph meaning integration.
5. Long-form attention and fatigue resistance.
6. No-subtitle robustness in authentic media.
7. Oral recap quality (short retell after listening).

## Level anchors
- 0: cannot reliably catch core meaning.
- 1: catches isolated words, weak message understanding.
- 2: catches topic and some details with support.
- 3: catches main flow in controlled materials.
- 4: catches most details in authentic materials.
- 5: robust no-subtitle understanding across topics.

## Current estimated baseline (to be validated)
- Sound decoding: 1
- Vocabulary recognition: 2
- Idiom/slang: 1
- Meaning integration: 2
- Long-form endurance: 2
- No-subtitle robustness: 1
- Oral recap quality: 1

## Validation rule
- Keep estimates provisional until first 3 real lessons are logged.
