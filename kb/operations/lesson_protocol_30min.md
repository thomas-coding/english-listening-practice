# 30-Min Lesson Protocol

## Default structure
- 0-3 min: objective and attention target.
- 3-10 min: first-pass listening (no pause).
- 10-18 min: second-pass repair (targeted replay).
- 18-24 min: focused extraction (errors + chunks).
- 24-29 min: spoken recap (45-90 seconds).
- 29-30 min: score + next action.

## Required outputs
- One-sentence gist.
- At least 3 corrected listening errors.
- At least 5 reusable chunks.
- One spoken recap.

## Pass/fail decision
- Pass: gist clear + error correction complete + recap done.
- Borderline: gist weak but corrected with replay.
- Fail: gist missing and no usable recap.
