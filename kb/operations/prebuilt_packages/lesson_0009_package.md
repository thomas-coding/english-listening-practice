## Correction guide
- Expected gist:
  - Main A: using a fake errand to start conversation and pivot into invitation.
  - Main B: parent-school conflict over class placement.
- Target chunks:
  - `junk mail`
  - `in case of an emergency`
  - `film festival`
  - `refuse to be separated`
  - `make mincemeat out of you`
- Likely errors -> repair:
  - `junk mail` heard as person name -> replay with pause before `mail`.
  - `Rialto Film Festival` dropped -> keep as gist-only item if full phrase too heavy.
  - idiom sprint failure -> keep expression form first, then attach meaning in Chinese.
