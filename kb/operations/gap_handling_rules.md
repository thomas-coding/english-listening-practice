# Gap Handling Rules (Irregular Lesson Intervals)

## Why
- Learner schedule is variable; system must remain effective despite gaps.

## Gap tiers
- Gap A: 1-3 days -> normal progression.
- Gap B: 4-10 days -> 1 reactivation block before new content.
- Gap C: 11-30 days -> half lesson for recovery + review queue first.
- Gap D: >30 days -> mini reassessment + temporary stage lock.

## Reactivation block template (8-12 minutes)
1. 1 short familiar clip no-sub first pass.
2. quick error repair.
3. 30-45s recap.

## Logging requirement
- Each lesson log entry must include `days_since_last_lesson`.
